[[run]]
== Run the application

. Git clone the timefold-quickstarts repo and navigate to this directory:
+
[source, shell]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/TimefoldAI/timefold-quickstarts.git
...
$ cd timefold-quickstarts/use-cases/employee-scheduling
----

. Start the application with Maven:
+
[source, shell]
----
$ mvn quarkus:dev
----

. Visit http://localhost:8080 in your browser.

. Click on the *Solve* button.

Then try _live coding_:

. Make some changes in the source code.
. Refresh your browser (F5).

Notice that those changes are immediately in effect.


[[package]]
== Run the packaged application

When you're done iterating in `quarkus:dev` mode,
package the application to run as a conventional jar file.

. Compile it with Maven:
+
[source, shell]
----
$ mvn package
----

. Run it:
+
[source, shell]
----
$ java -jar ./target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar
----
+
[NOTE]
====
To run it on port 8081 instead, add `-Dquarkus.http.port=8081`.
====

. Visit http://localhost:8080 in your browser.

. Click on the *Solve* button.

[[container]]
== Run the application in a container

. Build a container image:
+
[source, shell]
----
$ mvn package -Dcontainer
----
The container image name
. Run a container:
+
[source, shell]
----
$ docker run -p 8080:8080 $USER/timefold-solver-quarkus-employee-scheduling-quickstart:1.0-SNAPSHOT
----

[[native]]
== Run it native

To increase startup performance for serverless deployments,
build the application as a native executable:

. https://quarkus.io/guides/building-native-image#configuring-graalvm[Install GraalVM and gu install the native-image tool]

. Compile it natively. This takes a few minutes:
+
[source, shell]
----
$ mvn package -Dnative -DskipTests
----

. Run the native executable:
+
[source, shell]
----
$ ./target/*-runner
----

. Visit http://localhost:8080 in your browser.

. Click on the *Solve* button.
